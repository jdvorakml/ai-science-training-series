What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it?

This answer is based on my personal view as a theoretical postdoc in the fundamental research in the Atomic,
Molecular, and Optical Sciences. 

At this moment, I don't use any LLMs in my research. I spent some time with ChatGPT but
the answers are not very reliable and I feel like to check everything renders the LLMs
not very useful in my case. Another problem I have with the current LLMs is that they basically always 
have an answer and are not able to determined that the task is beyond their capabilities. I understand
that it comes from the probabilistic nature of the models.
However, I see two good use cases for my work after improving the abilities of LLMs.

1) Using LLMs to find and summarize relevant literature and references: 
Especially when starting a new project, reviewing the existing literature is tedious task
because in my field there may be ~50 years of research. The first easier task that
would be useful is to only find the relevant references including the very new ones.
It is possible that this currently works. Second, it would be useful to summarize and extract
information from the references. For example, I often times look for potential energies
of various molecular and ion states but different calculations focused on different subsets 
of the states. Thus, it would be very useful if the LLMS could collect the data from multiple
papers but keep the references to the original sources to easily verify or look for more details.


2) Help with writing code and test it:
A large part of my work is writing code for numerical simulations. I know that there are many LLMs 
that focus on this task. I haven't used them myself yet but I watched some videos. It seems that
some of them works well for simple tasks but I haven't seen their use for a more complex tasks. 


This course motivated me to look more into the current available LLMs. In general, I would appreciate
LLMs for automating routine but tedious tasks while I can do the hard thinking.
